	abstract = {Server virtualization opens up a range of new possibilities for autonomic datacenter management, through the availability of new automation mechanisms that can be exploited to control and monitor tasks running within virtual machines. This offers not only new and more flexible control to the operator using a management console, but also more powerful and flexible autonomic control, through management software that maintains the system in a desired state in the face of changing workload and demand. This paper explores in particular the use of server virtualization technology in the autonomic management of data centers running a heterogeneous mix of workloads. We present a system that manages heterogeneous workloads to their performance goals and demonstrate its effectiveness via real-system experiments and simulation. We also present some of the significant challenges to wider usage of virtual servers in autonomic datacenter management.},

Cloud technology is moving towards more distribution across multi-clouds and the inclusion of various devices, as evident through IoT and network integration in the context of edge cloud and fog computing. Generally, lightweight virtualisation solutions are beneficial for this architectural setting with smaller, but still virtualised devices to host application and platform services, and the logistics required to manage this. Containerisation is currently discussed as a lightweight virtualisation solution. In addition to having benefits over traditional virtual machines in the cloud in terms of size and flexibility, containers are specifically relevant for platform concerns typically dealt with Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) clouds such as application packaging and orchestration. For the edge cloud environment, application and service orchestration can help to manage and orchestrate applications through containers as an application packaging mechanism. We review edge cloud requirements and discuss the suitability container and cluster technology of that arise from having to facilitate applications through distributed multi-cloud platforms build from a range of networked nodes ranging from data centres to small devices, which we refer to here as edge cloud.},

	abstract = {Background: Word learning is an important component of language development that influences child outcomes across multiple domains. Despite the importance of word knowledge, word-learning mechanisms are poorly understood in children with specific language impairment (SLI) and children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This study examined underlying mechanisms of word learning, specifically, statistical learning and fast-mapping, in school-aged children with typical and atypical development. Methods: Statistical learning was assessed through a word segmentation task and fast-mapping was examined in an object-label association task. We also examined children's ability to map meaning onto newly segmented words in a third task that combined exposure to an artificial language and a fast-mapping task. Results: Children with SLI had poorer performance on the word segmentation and fast-mapping tasks relative to the typically developing and ASD groups, who did not differ from one another. However, when children with SLI were exposed to an artificial language with phonemes used in the subsequent fast- mapping task, they successfully learned more words than in the isolated fast-mapping task. There was some evidence that word segmentation abilities are associated with word learning in school-aged children with typical development and ASD, but not SLI. Follow-up analyses also examined performance in children with ASD who did and did not have a language impairment. Children with ASD with language impairment evidenced intact statistical learning abilities, but subtle weaknesses in fast-mapping abilities. Conclusions: As the Procedural Deficit Hypothesis (PDH) predicts, children with SLI have impairments in statistical learning. However, children with SLI also have impairments in fast-mapping. Nonetheless, they are able to take advantage of additional phonological exposure to boost subsequent word-learning performance. In contrast to the PDH, children with ASD appear to have intact statistical learning, regardless of language status; however, fast-mapping abilities differ according to broader language skills.},

We evaluate the performance differences caused by the different virtualization technologies in data center environments where mul-tiple applications are running on the same servers (multi-tenancy). Our results show that co-located applications can cause performance interference, and the degree of interference is higher in the case of containers for certain types of workloads. We also evaluate differ-ences in the management frameworks which control deployment and orchestration of containers and VMs. We show how the differ-ent capabilities exposed by the two virtualization technologies can affect the management and development of applications. Lastly, we evaluate novel approaches which combine hardware and OS virtu-alization.},

Applications relying on container architectures might at times rely on inter-container communication, and container networking solutions are emerging to address this need. Containers can be networked together as part of an overlay network, or with actual links from the container to the network via kernel modules. Most overlay solutions are not quite production ready yet; on the other hand kernel modules that can link a container to the network are much more mature. We benchmarked three kernel modules: veth, macvlan and ipvlan, to quantify their respective raw TCP and UDP performance and scalability. Our results show that the macvlan kernel module outperforms all other solutions in raw performance.

	abstract = {Virtualization became recently a hot topic once again, after being dormant for more than twenty years. In the meantime, it has been almost forgotten, that virtual machines are not so perfect isolating environments as it seems, when looking at the principles. These lessons were already learnt earlier when the first virtualized systems have been exposed to real life usage. Contemporary virtualization software enables instant creation and destruction of virtual machines on a host, live migration from one host to another, execution history manipulation, etc. These features are very useful in practice, but also causing headaches among security specialists, especially in current hostile network environments. In the present contribution we discuss the principles, potential benefits and risks of virtualization in a deja vu perspective, related to previous experiences with virtualization in the mainframe era.},

	abstract = {NATO and the nations use distributed simulation environments for various purposes, such as training, mission rehearsal, and decision support in acquisition processes. Consequently, modeling and simulation (M\&S) has become a critical technology for the coalition and its nations. Achieving interoperability between participating simulation systems and ensuring credibility of results currently often requires enormous effort with regards to time, personnel, and budget. Recent technical developments in the area of cloud computing technology and service oriented architecture (SOA) may offer opportunities to better utilize M\&S capabilities in order to satisfy NATO critical needs. A new concept that includes service orientation and the provision of M\&S applications via the as-a-service model of cloud computing may enable composable simulation environments that can be deployed rapidly and on-demand. This new concept is known as M\&S as a Service (MSaaS). There has also been the recent emergence of containerization as an alternative to virtualization. Containerization is the process of creating, packaging, distributing, deploying, and executing applications in a lightweight and standardized process execution environment known as a container. Because containers are, in principle, lightweight, they are suitable to serve as the vehicle for the provision of packaged (micro)services. Service orientation is an approach to the design of heterogeneous, distributed systems in which solution logic is structured in the form of interoperating services. This paper investigates various aspects of service orientation and containerization including simulation composition , networking, discovery, scalability, and overall performance. This investigation provides background information on the topics of service orientation, containerization, and Docker-a technology ecosystem for working with containers. A case study is presented for the use of Docker in support of a training simulation based on the high level architecture (HLA). The HLA is an IEEE standard architecture for distributed simulation environments that was originally developed for defense applications. The case study introduces a number of training use cases, and shows how Docker can be used to assist in their implementation. The performance impact of running a simulation within container technology is also investigated. The application of container technology to HLA-based simulations as presented in this paper is novel. The motivation for looking at this topic stems from the activity being conducted within NATO MSG-136.},

	abstract = {As REST architectural style gains popularity in the web service community, there is a growing concern and debate on how to design Restful web services (REST API) in a proper way. We attribute this problem to lack of a standard model and language to describe a REST API that respects all the REST constraints. As a result, many web services that claim to be REST API are not hypermedia driven as prescribed by REST. This situation may lead to REST APIs that are not as scalable, extensible, and interoperable as promised by REST. To address this issue, this paper proposes REST Chart as a model and language to design and describe REST API without violating the REST constraints. REST Chart models a REST API as a special type of Colored Petri Net whose topology defines the REST API and whose token markings define the representational state space of user agents using that API. We demonstrate REST Chart with an example REST API. We also show how REST Chart can support efficient content negotiation and reuse hybrid representations to broaden design choices. Furthermore, we argue that the REST constraints, such as hypermedia driven and statelessness, can either be enforced naturally or checked automatically in REST Chart.},

A Virtual Machine (VM) created on the host hardware as a software is called a hypervisor or a VM manager. Nowadays, hypervisor based virtualization is the most prevailing technology for virtual environment. It is supple and performs for equivalently any guest operating system (OS) but it leads to overload on memory and CPU. Nevertheless, container based virtualization (or OS virtualization) technique which allows various different VMs employed on top of running kernel. Unalike the existing virtualization approach, a containerization does not execute a VM as a complete OS instance but runs as partial instances of the OS which reduces the CPU and memory overload and also provides the portability due to small size of containers. Docker is a tool to make Linux Containers (LXC) easier to use. Docker containers could be specifically deployed for the applications and systems deployment using lightweight containerization technique which results reducing economical overload instead of VMs over Cloud.

As the technology matures and advances are made, there are more options open to administrators and more cost saving virtualization projects that can be implemented. The websites and articles listed in the reference section, give you some idea of the capability using the VMWare product, which is simply one of several virtualization options. Any company currently using physical servers can benefit from the cost savings and management simplification of a virtualized server environment. Virtualization allows for the maximizing of hardware through the sharing of resources. A virtualized environment is also easier to backup and restore for disaster recovery purposes. ESXi is a free product, and virtualization can often be achieved on existing hardware. The purpose of this review is to look at virtualization from the perspective of scholarly writers, but also understand how to implement a virtual environment that addresses the high cost of physical servers and rack space and can be implemented with very few tem members. This also addresses the ability of virtual environments to minimize downtime and simplify management. As for the need, all companies have a need to reduce costs and increase efficiency, and this type of project has a high ROI in both areas. This project will include research into the latest trends in virtualization. This has a direct application to business, strategic planning, and IT in general since this technology is rapidly permeating through the environments of IT departments and businesses around the world. Much scholarly work has also been done into the concept of virtualization, the impact on business in terms of ROI, disaster recovery, and reduced administration as well as the future of the technology in general.},

Second, we present the results of a small-scale experiment that suggests that even modest training in microskills can benefit advising sessions.},

Auf diesen Trend stellen sich auch die traditionellen Anbieter von Telekommunikationsanlagen ein. Neue Technologien – wie Voice over IP – lassen innovative Geschäftsmodelle und neue Dienstleistungen entstehen. Von der daraus resultierenden Angebotsvielfalt profitieren die Kunden. Mit der Verbreitung neuer Systeme erhöht sich aber immer auch das Risiko für Angriffe. Schwachstellen können von potenziellen Angreifern gefunden und unlauter ausgenutzt werden. Voice over IP (VoIP) bildet hierbei keine Ausnahme. Die vorliegende Studie beschäftigt sich daher mit der Sicherheit von VoIP-Systemen. Sie beleuchtet, was bei der Konvergenz von Sprach- und Datendiensten technisch und organisatorisch notwendig ist. Aufgezeigt werden die Grundlagen der Echtzeitübertragung von Informationen über ein IP-Netz. Ebenfalls betrachtet werden die drei Säulen der IT-Sicherheit, Vertraulichkeit, Integrität und Verfügbarkeit, wobei der Aspekt Verfügbarkeit in vielen Fällen eine besonders wichtige Rolle spielt. Den Vorteilen der VoIP-Technik wird damit eine detaillierte Sicherheitsbetrachtung gegenübergestellt. Ob und inwieweit VoIP eine Alternative zu herkömmlichen Technologien darstellt, muss immer imEinzelfall entschieden werden. Was am Ende zählt ist die Sicherheit – ohne Ausnahme.},

	abstract = {Many organisations are moving over from legacy telecommunications to Voice over IP (VoIP), enabling greater flexibility, resilience and an overall cost reduction. Session Initiated Protocol (SIP) is now considered to be the main VoIP protocol in the business?to-business market, but the correct implementation and configuration is not always well-understood. The failure to configure SIP systems correctly has led to significant fraud exploiting a range of vulnerabilities and billions of dollars every year being stolen from companies of all sizes through PBX Hacking via the medium of Toll Fraud. Previous research into this area is now dated but suggests a fast-changing approach by the attackers. Industry organisations such as the Communications Fraud Control Association (CFCA) acknowledge that this is a fast-growing problem. To quantify the size of the current problem, a Honeypot experiment was undertaken using a popular phone system used by businesses. The Honeypot ran for 10 days and recorded just under 19 million SIP messages. This research has identified the rate of attack is approximately 30 times more aggressive than previous reported research.},

38 international organizations participate in ITU-T which is the body which sets world telecommunications standards
(Recommendations).
The approval of Recommendations by the Members of ITU-T is covered by the procedure laid down in WTSC
Resolution No. 1 (Helsinki, 1993). In addition, the World Telecommunication Standardization Conference (WTSC),
which meets every four years, approves Recommendations submitted to it and establishes the study programme for the
following period.
In some areas of information technology which fall within ITU-T’s purview, the necessary standards are prepared on a
collaborative basis with ISO and IEC. The text of ITU-T Recommendation X.200 was approved on 1st of July 1994. The
identical text is also published as ISO/IEC International Standard 7498-1.},
